# YouTube Music (Free) — Music Assistant Provider

A custom Music Assistant provider that streams YouTube Music **without a premium subscription**, using the same technique as open-source players like [SimpMusic](https://github.com/maxrave-dev/SimpMusic).

## How it works

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| `ytmusicapi` | Search, metadata, and library sync (optional auth) |
| `yt-dlp` (android_music client) | Extract direct audio stream URLs and playlist tracks |

YouTube's Android Music client API does not require a PO token or login session, so audio streams can be resolved for free-tier content. This is the same method used by NewPipe and SimpMusic on Android.

For playlists, `yt-dlp` is used as a fallback when `ytmusicapi` cannot parse the unauthenticated playlist response from YouTube, ensuring playlists work without a login.

> **Note:** This uses YouTube's internal (unofficial) API. It may break if Google changes their API. Premium-exclusive content (offline, high-res audio) is not accessible.

## Installation

Music Assistant runs as a Docker container (HA add-on). The provider files must be copied **inside the container** — placing them in `/config/` is not sufficient.

### Quick install (recommended)

One-line install from a shell with **host Docker access**. On Home Assistant OS that means the **Advanced SSH & Web Terminal** community add-on with **Protection mode off** (the official Terminal & SSH add-on is sandboxed and cannot reach Docker, so the script aborts with `required command not found: docker`). On a Supervised install, a normal root SSH session works:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sproft/music-assistant-ytmusic/main/scripts/install_provider.sh | sh
```

The script auto-detects your MA container ID, Python version, and `/config` path, downloads the latest provider, stages it under `/config/custom_components/mass/providers/`, copies it into the MA container, and restarts MA. Re-run anytime to upgrade.

> **No Docker in your shell?** On Home Assistant OS the watcher add-on route does not need Docker in your terminal: run `install_watcher_addon.sh` (see below), then install and start the **MA Provider Watcher** local add-on with Protection mode off. It injects the provider for you and keeps it installed across restarts.

Then jump to step 4 below to add the provider in the MA UI, and see [WATCHER_ADDON.md](WATCHER_ADDON.md) (or the quick installer further down) to make the install survive HA restarts.

### Manual install

### 1. Find your MA container name

In an HAOS / Supervised setup the container is typically named:
```
addon_d5369777_music_assistant
```
Confirm it with:
```bash
docker ps | grep music
```

### 2. Copy the provider into the container

```bash
docker cp /path/to/ytmusic_free \
  addon_d5369777_music_assistant:/app/venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/music_assistant/providers/
```

Replace `/path/to/ytmusic_free` with wherever you placed the folder (e.g. `/config/custom_components/mass/providers/ytmusic_free`).

> **Note on Python version:** If MA ever upgrades its Python version, adjust `python3.13` in the path accordingly. Check with:
> ```bash
> docker exec addon_d5369777_music_assistant ls /app/venv/lib/
> ```

### 3. Restart Music Assistant

```bash
docker restart addon_d5369777_music_assistant
```

> **Important:** Restarting MA from the Home Assistant UI recreates the container from its image, wiping any files you copied in. Always use `docker restart` to preserve the provider files.

### 4. Add the provider in MA

Go to **Settings → Apps → Add** in the MA UI. You should see **"YouTube Music (Free)"** listed. No credentials are required for basic playback.

### Keeping the provider across HA restarts

If you restart HA (not just MA), the container is recreated and the provider files are lost. The recommended fix is the **MA Provider Watcher** local add-on, which re-copies the provider whenever the MA container is recreated. One-line install from a host shell:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sproft/music-assistant-ytmusic/main/scripts/install_watcher_addon.sh | sh
```

To re-install or upgrade an existing watcher add-on without the overwrite prompt, pass `--force` through to the script with `sh -s --`:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sproft/music-assistant-ytmusic/main/scripts/install_watcher_addon.sh | sh -s -- --force
```

> Note the `sh -s --` separator. Writing `... | sh --force` makes the shell parse `--force` as one of its own options and fail with `sh: bad option '--force'`.

See **[WATCHER_ADDON.md](WATCHER_ADDON.md)** for the manual procedure, troubleshooting, and the available installer flags.

> **If the automatic installer doesn't work on your system,** the [`v0.1.0-beta.1` pre-release](https://github.com/sproft/music-assistant-ytmusic/releases/tag/v0.1.0-beta.1) is a known-good checkpoint of the manual install path. Pin to it (the manual procedure in `WATCHER_ADDON.md` from that tag was the only documented option at the time and works on HAOS and Supervised installs) and please [open an issue](https://github.com/sproft/music-assistant-ytmusic/issues/new) so the installer can be fixed.

## Authentication (optional)

Authentication is **not required** for search, browse, and playback. However, authenticating unlocks:

- Library sync (liked songs, saved albums, playlists, subscribed artists)
- Personalized recommendations (home feed)
- Library editing (add/remove items)

There are two options:

| Option | Setup effort | Durability |
|--------|--------------|------------|
| **OAuth** (recommended) | A few one-time steps in Google Cloud Console | Self-refreshes; survives idle periods and restarts |
| **Browser cookie** | Paste one header | Goes stale over time and must be re-pasted |

> **Which should I use?** A browser cookie is a static snapshot of a Google session. On a headless Music Assistant box the session rotates server-side and the snapshot stops matching, so library/playlists/home feed quietly stop working and the cookie has to be re-pasted (see [#11](https://github.com/sproft/music-assistant-ytmusic/issues/11)). OAuth issues a long-lived refresh token that mints fresh access tokens on demand, so it does not have this problem. Use the cookie for a quick try, OAuth for set-and-forget.

### Option 1: OAuth (recommended)

OAuth needs your own Google OAuth client. Since 2024 Google requires the **"TVs and Limited Input devices"** client type for `ytmusicapi`.

1. **Create an OAuth client:**
   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), create (or pick) a project.
   - **APIs & Services → Library →** enable the **YouTube Data API v3**.
   - **APIs & Services → Credentials → Create Credentials → OAuth client ID**.
   - For **Application type**, choose **TVs and Limited Input devices**.
   - Note the generated **Client ID** and **Client secret**.
2. **Generate the token** on any machine that has Python and `ytmusicapi` installed:
   ```bash
   pip install ytmusicapi
   ytmusicapi oauth --client-id YOUR_CLIENT_ID --client-secret YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
   ```
   Follow the prompt (visit the URL, enter the code, approve). This writes an `oauth.json` file in the current directory containing a `refresh_token`.
3. **In the MA UI**, go to **Settings → Music sources → YouTube Music (Free)** and set **Authentication** to **OAuth (recommended)**.
4. Paste the **entire contents of `oauth.json`** into the **OAuth token (JSON)** field, and fill in the **OAuth client ID** and **OAuth client secret** with the same values from step 1.
5. Click **Save**. The provider validates the token on startup and refreshes it automatically from then on, including across Home Assistant restarts.

### Option 2: Browser cookie (quick start)

1. In the MA UI, go to **Settings → Music sources → YouTube Music (Free)**
2. Set **Authentication** to **Browser cookie**
3. Get your cookie:
   - Open `music.youtube.com` in your browser while logged in
   - Open DevTools (F12) → **Network** tab → reload the page
   - Click the first request → find the `Cookie:` header → copy the full value
4. Paste the cookie into the **Cookie header** field
5. **Brand accounts:** If your YouTube Music library is on a brand account, enter your brand account ID in the **Brand account ID** field. Find it at [myaccount.google.com/brandaccounts](https://myaccount.google.com/brandaccounts) or check the `X-Goog-PageId` header in DevTools. After logging into your Google account and selecting the correct Brand account you will find it here: ```https://myaccount.google.com/brandaccounts/THISISYOURIDRIGHTHERE/view```.
6. Click **Save**

The cookie must contain `__Secure-3PAPISID`, `SID`, `HSID`, and `SSID`. Cookies are valid for approximately 2 years unless you log out, but in practice the session is often invalidated much sooner on a headless server. If library sync stops working, re-paste a fresh cookie or switch to OAuth.

## Troubleshooting

**Provider doesn't appear in MA**
- Confirm the folder is named exactly `ytmusic_free` and contains both `__init__.py` and `manifest.json`.
- Verify the files are inside the container, not just in `/config/`.
- Check MA logs for import errors during startup.

**Track fails to play / `UnplayableMediaError`**
- yt-dlp may need updating: run `pip install -U yt-dlp` inside the MA container.
- Some tracks are region-locked or removed and cannot be streamed.

**Playlist shows "No playable items found"**
- Ensure you are on the latest version of this provider (playlist support uses a yt-dlp fallback added after the initial release).
- Very large playlists may take a few seconds to load as yt-dlp fetches the track list.

**Audio quality is low**
- Enable "Prefer highest audio quality" in the provider settings (on by default).
- The android_music client typically provides 128–256 kbps AAC or Opus in an M4A/WebM container.

**Cookie authentication failed**
- Make sure you copied the **entire** cookie string from the Network tab (2000+ characters).
- The cookie must contain `__Secure-3PAPISID`, `SID`, `HSID`, and `SSID`.
- If you use a brand account, enter the brand account ID (21-digit number from [myaccount.google.com/brandaccounts](https://myaccount.google.com/brandaccounts)).

**OAuth authentication failed**
- The OAuth token field must contain the **full JSON** from `oauth.json`, including the `refresh_token` field, not just the access token.
- The client ID and client secret must match the ones you generated the token with, and must be from a **"TVs and Limited Input devices"** OAuth client.
- Make sure the **YouTube Data API v3** is enabled for the project the client belongs to.

**Library is empty after auth**
- Your YouTube Music library only shows content you've explicitly liked, saved, or subscribed to.
- If your library is on a brand account, make sure the brand account ID is set.

**Files disappear after restarting Home Assistant**
- Only use `docker restart addon_d5369777_music_assistant` to restart MA.
- Restarting HA from the UI recreates the container from scratch. See [WATCHER_ADDON.md](WATCHER_ADDON.md) to set up automatic re-copying.
