"""Regression tests for mixes, song radio and editorial playlists (issue #47).

"RD" is not one family. Which endpoint can answer depends on which kind it is,
and all of the following were measured against the live services:

* song radio ``RD<videoId>`` / ``RDAMVM<videoId>``: ``get_playlist`` raises a
  ``KeyError``, ``playlist?list=RD...`` is rejected with "This playlist type is
  unviewable", and only the watch endpoint answers (147 tracks)
* personal mixes ``RDTMAK5uy_...`` ("My Supermix"): carry no seed video in the
  id, so a watch URL cannot be built for them without one
* editorial playlists ``RDCLAK5uy_...`` ("'80s Pop"): not radio at all. These
  read normally through ``get_playlist`` and are most of what the home feed
  hands out. The watch endpoint answers for them too, but only with a queue's
  worth, so sending them there loses tracks: 200 the ordinary way, 101 the
  watch way.

The original defect was that a mix resolved to zero tracks and playback had
nothing to start, while every failure on the way was discarded without a log
line.

These tests pin the routing so the URL shapes cannot be conflated again, pin
which family goes to which endpoint, and pin the reshaping that the watch
endpoint's track format requires.
